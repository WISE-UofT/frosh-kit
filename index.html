                        <p>The Women in Science and Engineering â€“ University of Toronto (WISE U of T) Chapter was established in 1999 to 
                            support and empower women in STEM fields and help them achieve their full potential as future engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists,
                            and leaders. The organization has since developed into one of the largest and highly regarded campus organizations with
                            over 1500 members.</p>
                        <p>We aim to empower women by building necessary leadership skills and confidence to be successful in the various STEM
                            fields. Through our initiatives, we hope to inspire and encourage women to pursue STEM programs at a 
                            post-secondary level and broaden students' horizons, so that they can also make positive impact in their 
                            professional career!</p>

                                            <p>Being a woman in engineering at UofT means being part of a world-class community of students, professors and

                                                to the table with their different perspectives and life experiences. In our experiences, our gender has had no

                                                at some point, even if they hide it well - so donâ€™t let your feelings get the best of you! You were accepted for a 
                                                reason and your undergraduate engineering degree is a perfect place to develop your skills and grow!

                                            Q6. How do you allocate your time, especially for remote learning?<i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i></a>
                                        <div id="faq6" class="collapse" data-parent="#faq-common">
                                            <p>Remote learning can be difficult because of the flexibility that comes with online lectures. If your professor 
                                                posts lecture recordings, it can be easy to tune out or skip class. The best advice for time management in this 
                                                situation is to create a schedule for yourself. Plan out regular times to watch lectures and donâ€™t forget to 
                                                take breaks too to minimize screen fatigue! Once you develop a routine, it will help you stay on track and not 
                                                fall behind.</p>

                                                Most clubs that can function online will be running in the fall. There will also be a virtual clubs fair so stay 
                                                tuned for that (see Q3)! For design teams, you can reach out to the executives listed on their website or social media. 
                                                Some clubs have already finished their recruitment for the fall, however, it is still possible to join as a 
                                                general member in September. This will depend on the club and it is best that you check with them (go to clubs fair)!</p>

                                            <p>In engineering, there are dinner dances for each discipline (ex. 8-Ball for track ones, ECE dinner dance) hosted by discipline clubs. 
                                                However, you don't need to be part of a discpline to attend that dinner dance. Engineering also has a annual semi-formal called 
                                                called Cannonball, hosted by the Engineering Society and usually held during at the end of Godiva Week.</p>
                                            <p>If you are part of an ArtSci college, colleges might also have their own galas as well. Many clubs, such as WISE, also have the International Women's Day Gala in March!</p>
